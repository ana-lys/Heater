# SMD Hotplate Control with ESP32 and Android App

This repository contains the code and resources for controlling a Surface Mount Device (SMD) hotplate using an ESP32 microcontroller and an Android app.

## Setup

Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **HotPlate ESP32 Schematic, PCB, and Code**: Schematic, PCB design, and code for the HotPlate in the PCB folder: [Proteus & Arduino code](PCB).

2. **MQTT Server**: Create a new account at [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/) and choose the free plan "Little Lemur" to start your own MQTT server.

3. **Download OpenCV 4.6.0 for Android**: Download the OpenCV 4.6.0 library for Android from the official OpenCV website [ OpenCV_release ](https://opencv.org/releases/).

4. **Clone this git and Add OpenCV Dependency**: Add the OpenCV dependency to your Android project [(reference)](https://youtu.be/bR7lL886-uc?si=be9SiwEaWzrY5g5j) and start building it using KTS Gradle.

5. **Install and Enjoy**: Install the Android app on your device and use it to control the SMD hotplate.

Please refer to the respective documentation and resources provided in the links above for detailed instructions on each step.
